## Compiler for C written in Haskell

As the name suggests, giraffecc is a project that will span for the following weeks where I'll upload each week a new part of a compiler for the C language, entirely written in Haskell. 
 Each weekly release will be accompanied by a description file of all my choices. 
 
 Feel free to ask me questions or make suggestions.
