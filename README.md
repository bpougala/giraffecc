## Compiler for C written in Haskell

As the name suggests, giraffecc is a project that will span for the following weeks where I'll upload each week a new part of a compiler for the C language, entirely written in Haskell. 
 Each weekly release will be accompanied by a description file of all my choices. 
 
 Feel free to ask me questions or make suggestions. 


### 01/11/2018 - Week 1 
For the first week, we'll start with a very simple compiler that can compile C files with a unique main function that returns integers.
